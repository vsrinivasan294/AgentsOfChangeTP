Kennedy, Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, Barack Obama, Nelson Mandela, Cesar Chavez, etc Tutors will come prepared with questions, and slowly read chapter by chapter, according to the student’s ability and needs Tutors are all very proficient in reading and writing (many have taken AP classes and other standardized tests in English), and are passionate and knowledgeable about the subject. Tutors can help with translations between English, Chinese, Spanish, Tamil, and Hindi, so people who do not know English can understand what everything means. A gamified system will help and increase the intrinsic motivation of the students to learn the material and apply. Curriculum: Curriculum will depend on an individual student’s needs, so there is no set curriculum. However, the overall plan is to focus on pronunciation of words and practice of good reading habits. Tutors will customize plans for each study session. So depending on the overall standing of the student, the tutor will have a specific study plan to help the student acquire the best kind of help. Material: We use the conventional physical books, curriculum for specific words and styles of the language, language structure, and also an interactive online app to gauge where one stands and how to improve the student’s skills. Progress: Progress will be gauged on a tutor’s evaluation of each student. If a tutor notices problems in a student’s progress, he or she will assess the situation and adjust methods.
